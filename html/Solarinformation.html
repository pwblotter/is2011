    <h4>Preston W. Blotter</h4>
    <p>I am a Professional soalr sales man. I work In the inland empire area in California. Ive been going all over from Norco to Chino
        all the way up to Yuciapa. Every year more and more people are switching to solar because the benifits outweigh the cons. Although solar isnt all
        roses and daises it is one of the biggest no brainers you can do financially.
        I have been selling solar for two years now and it is my passion. I sell for MPWR solar company
        based out of Utah County, Utah. I install with Energy Service Partners (esp), and Empower solar. ESP is a 
        bigger company based out of California. One of the biggest solar installers in all of California. Empower is a much smaller installer thats just getting going 
        in California.
